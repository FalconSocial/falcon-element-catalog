## Introduction

Before you go ahead and start building your Component, A TP Ticket is needed !
This allows the members of the Component Team track which components are being developed by who,
list intentions, review and comments.

## Requirements

* Access to the Component Team TP board.

If you don't have access to the Component Team TP board already please ask
Hans: `hans@falconsocial.com` to add you to our TP board.

## Creating a Ticket

Let's say for example we would like to create a new component: eyas-window !
This is an amazing component that works like an eyas-card but with much nicer borders.
